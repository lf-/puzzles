# programming puzzles

Various programming puzzle solutions from e.g. Project Euler.

### sieve

An implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes in C and in Python.
I wrote these because I wanted to get more understanding of C and wanted to
figure out how to quickly write a prime number sieve for these fairly-common
puzzles in programming contests, for example.

The Python one is an order of magnitude slower than the C one.
